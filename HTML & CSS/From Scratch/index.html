      <p>My name is David Gibson</p>
      <p>I am originally from south Florida. I spent most of my life there and I moved up here a few years ago to live with my fiance. I am taking this course as part of a second Bachelor's. I chose computer science because I grew up around computers and video games and I've always been interested in how they work and all the behind-the-scenes details. This interest only grew as I got older and so I found myself leaning towards CS from all the options during my first year of higher education. I chose Web Applications sounds like something that could be useful in my future, wherever that takes me.</p>
      <p>I have created websites with boostrap before, but it has been years and I am super rusty. I look forward to refreshing my skills with this page.</p>
